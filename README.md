# Frontend Coding Challenge

Hello there, thanks again for your interest in Trade Republic. To kick off the
interview process we have prepared a short coding exercise for you, to demonstrate your knowledge of the language and
tools we use to develop our web applications.

**Please note: The coding test should show that you feel comfortable working with any JavaScript framework. We use
Vue.js and prefer it but you can use another framework if you feel that it will better show off your skills. The
assessment of your submission will not change if you use a different framework.**

In case you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your dedicated recruiter.

## Context

Developing our app, we work with a REST API as well as real-time streaming market
data to display the latest stock prices with millisecond latency. You should feel
comfortable developing an app to address these two types of network interaction. The WebSocket server youâ€™ll be using
accepts and emits messages in JSON format.

## Things we care for:

âœ… Unit tests

âœ… Semantic HTML

âœ… Responsive Design

âœ… Documentation

âœ… Accessibility

## Nice to have:

ðŸ¤© Use of Reactive programming libraries like RxJS.

### Glossary

We donâ€™t expect you to be a trading expert and some of the terms are quite specific to the space. Hereâ€™s some of the
terms we use in the task:
| Term | Definition |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ISIN` | The 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a specific instrument |
| `instrument` | A tradable asset, or a negotiable item, such as a security, commodity, derivative, or index, or any
item that underlies a derivative. |
| `bid` | The highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of an instrument at any given time. |
| `ask` | The lowest price at which a seller will sell the instrument. |

## The Application

In the interest of saving you some time, we provided a working [Vue](https://vuejs.org) application. This application
also includes a small set of components for you to use. Please note, using these components is optional, you are welcome
to change them in any way you want, you should only submit something you are comfortable with.

## Using this application

### Pre-requisites

Please make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) 16 installed.

### Running the code

Once you have unzipped the folder and are ready to start, you can run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies.
After that, you can run:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# or yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. It will also start the WebSocket server on port 8425.

You can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

## Task Description

In this repository we have provided you with a minimal [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
application. Your task is to extend this app so that it allows a user to subscribe/unsubscribe to a list of stocks. The
user should be able to subscribe to a stock by entering its [ISIN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp) number
into an input and then see the current price of the stock displayed in a list view.

What we would like to see is clean, readable code that you would be **comfortable submitting to your colleagues for
review**. Please explain decisions that youâ€™ve made and what you would do if you had more time to continue development.
You can add them to this `README.md` file.

Requirements:

- We want to see how you interpret [user stories](#user-stories) into a solution, please fulfill all of the stories
  provided.
- Please avoid using a UI library, we want to be able to see your styling skills.
- We recommend using Vue but you can use a different framework if you feel that youâ€™ll be able to demonstrate your
  skills better.
- Great user experience is important to us at Trade Republic. Please approach the challenge from a userâ€™s perspective
  and build something you would be happy to put into userâ€™s hands.
- Please also provide setup instructions and answer the following [questions](#questions) in your README.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a form that allows a user to submit an ISIN and add it to a watch list.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to submit an ISIN and it should be added to my watch list.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to the same ISIN twice so that I donâ€™t get confused by seeing multiple
> versions of the same stock.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to an empty or invalid ISIN.

> Validation rules: An ISIN is a 12-character alphanumeric code. It consists of three parts: A two letter country code,
> a nine character alpha-numeric national security identifier, and a single check digit.
> Example:- US0378331005.

### Task 2

Create the UI and render the watch list created in the previous task to the DOM.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to view a list of my subscribed stocks displaying the latest stock price received from the
> WebSocket connection so that I can keep track of multiple stocks at the same time.

> As a user, I should be able to unsubscribe from a stock thatâ€™s in my watch list so that I can focus on the stocks Iâ€™m
> interested in.

> As a user, I should be notified if the websocket disconnects and the data is not up to date so that I know that the
> price is not accurate.

> As a user, I should be able to view their stocks on desktop and mobile screen widths so that I am able to use the app
> on my mobile browser.

### Task 3

At this point, you can consider the challenge to be complete.

This task is intentionally left open for you to add any feature you want to the application. Anything is valid, from
improvements to Accessibility all the way to UI Transitions, CSS, etc.

## Socket Reference

The WebSocket server is started when you run `yarn dev`. You can then connect to it at

```URL
ws://localhost:8425/
```

To subcribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
  "subscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

To unsubscribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
  "unsubscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

#### Example Request

To subscribe to the BASF instrument you would use

```JSON
{
  "subscribe": "DE000BASF111"
}
```

#### Sample Response

You would then receive a WebSocket stream with messages in the following format

```JSON
{
  "isin": "DE000BASF111",
  "price": 11.316359370403822,
  "bid": 11.306359370403822,
  "ask": 11.326359370403821
}
```

## Questions

1. What happens in case the WebSocket disconnects? How would you go further to keep
   the live data available or inform the user? Please discuss the challenges.
   ```text
   When the WebSocket disconnects, the socket connection doesn't just give up. 
   It tries to reconnect using something called exponential backoff, meaning it waits 
   a bit longer each time before trying again, up to a certain limit. To keep the live 
   data available, I'd probably look into resubscribing to the stocks we were watching
   once we reconnect, and maybe even fetch the latest data to make sure we didn't miss 
   anything. As for informing the user, that's where a clear status update on the front 
   end would come in handy. The challenges? Well, different errors might need different
   handling, and the delay between reconnect attempts might get too long if we're not
   careful. It's all about balancing persistence with the user's need for timely, 
   accurate information.
   ```
2. What happens if a user adds an instrument multiple times to their list? Please discuss possible challenges and
   mitigations.

    ```text
    When a user adds an instrument with a duplicate information to their list, several challenges 
    arise. The user interface may become cluttered, and redundant instruments can lead to inconsistent 
    data views. Additionally, if actions or alerts are associated with instruments, multiple instances
    might trigger unintended consequences. To mitigate these issues, the frontend should have a check
    in place to prevent users from adding duplicates. During integration, it's important to ensure 
    that the backend handles duplicates appropriately and that the frontend provides clear feedback 
    to guide users and avoid confusion. I noticed during integration that without a check in place,
    the backend doesn't seem to add duplicates to the list so nothing breaks.
    ```

3. What potential performance issues might you face when this app scales with multiple subscriptions? How would you
   improve the speed and user experience?

    ```text
    As the app scales with more subscriptions, several performance challenges can emerge.The growing 
    number of subscriptions can lead to a surge in network traffic, with messages between the server
    and client increasing substantially. Browsers have their own constraints; they can only handle 
    so many WebSocket connections, and if every subscription tries to establish a unique connection,
    we might max out quickly. On the backend, there's additional strain: more subscriptions mean more 
    processing, potentially slowing down responses. Meanwhile, the frontend faces its hurdles. 
    Handling and visually representing a vast influx of data in real-time demands resources, and this 
    could make the app sluggish. Not to forget, every active subscription eats into our memory, which, 
    if not kept in check, could lead to memory leaks. Lastly, every subscription might be tapping into
    our database, which can bog it down and cause delays.
    
    To enhance speed and user experience as the app scales, several strategies come to mind. First, 
    by employing multiplexing, we can manage multiple subscriptions through a single WebSocket 
    connection, streamlining communication while respecting browser constraints. Data compression 
    methods, such as MessagePack or WebSocket's inherent capabilities, can minimize data size 
    during transmissions. Rather than bombarding the UI with constant updates, techniques like 
    debouncing and throttling can control the update frequency, delivering a smoother experience. 
    By embracing efficient data structures like buffers and hashmaps, data processing becomes snappier. 
    On the backend, scaling becomes pivotalâ€”think of incorporating load balancers, optimizing queries,
    or even harnessing in-memory databases like Redis for brisk data access. 
    Frontend-wise, virtualization can be a game-changer, especially when dealing with extensive datasets,
    ensuring only visible components render.Additionally, considering lazy loading or pagination helps
    when users have a hefty number of subscriptions, only pulling in what's necessary. Optimizations 
    don't stop there: refined rendering techniques, from memoization to leveraging cutting-edge frontend
    frameworks, can drastically enhance responsiveness. And, of course, keeping users in the loop is 
    paramount; intuitive feedback mechanisms like spinners or progress bars make wait times more palatable. 
    Lastly, proactive monitoring tools are invaluable, keeping a watchful eye on performance metrics, 
    sending timely alerts, and helping pinpoint and address bottlenecks before they escalate.
